pleddit
=======
Pleddit is a simple angular-application that collects all the youtube-links from a subreddit of reddit.com and transforms it into a playlist.
It runs on flask, but should be fairly easy to use whatever you'd like (it's probably possible to just open the index.html locally)

A working version of the webpage is available at http://pleddit.com

TODO
====
* Soundcloud support
* ~~"reddit routing" - should be possible to just change from reddit.com/r/music/top to pleddit.com/r/music/top and it should redirect you to the correct pleddit url.~~ fixed
* Random song button should be toggleable
* Support multireddits
